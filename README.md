| **Change Case** | Convert case (upper, lower, title, camel, snake, kebab) | `My File` → `my_file` |
| **Numbering** | Add sequential numbers with customizable format | `song.mp3` → `001_song.mp3` |
| **Date/Time** | Insert current or file date | `photo` → `2024-01-15_photo` |
| **Trim & Clean** | Remove spaces, special characters, duplicates | `file  (1)` → `file_1` |

Operations are applied in order from top to bottom. Drag and drop to reorder.

## **Built-in Presets**

| **Number Files** | Adds sequential 3-digit numbers as prefix (001_, 002_, ...) |
| **Date Prefix** | Adds current date in YYYY-MM-DD format |

You can also create **custom presets** by saving your current operation combination with a custom name and icon.
